      <p class="letter">Happy 20th birthday, my pookie wookie boobiee woobieeeee! Today is a special day so you should be happyyyy! No negativity and no stress muna dapat hehe. <br><br>
        
      My wishes for you.<br><br>

      I want you to be happy! whether it's with me or not, I just want you to be happy, okay? Im soo happy knowing that you are surrounded by people who love you and care for youuu. I want you to be happy with your studies. I know you are struggling right now with your upcoming exams and projects, but I know you can do it!! Cause believe in youuuuuuuu. I want to say that Im so proud of you. Im so proud of your efforts, your focus, your determination, and how you never easily give up. Im sooo proud that youre trying to get things done at midnight even when you are tired. There's something about you that's so admirable talaga eeh, I think it's you being so funny and smiley (also... your brain is attractive to me hehe). I want you to feel less stressed and to get more sleep even in the most busiest situation... no more puyat please. Lastly, I want you to be happy with your family, I hope you get to spend more time with them and make more memories together. I hope you get to travel with them and enjoy life with them. 
        <br><br><br>
      You are special, SO SPECIAL TO ME<br><br>

      I cant say "i love you" just yet, because I think it's stiiiiiill too early for that, but i want you to know that you are more than just a friend to me. I dont like rushing things kasi, so let me take my time to get to know you more and be more comfortable with you. I hope you erase the idea na pinapaasa kita, na hindi ko nakikita na hinihintay mo pa rin ako. If you feel that way, im so sorry. Im so glad we met again, is this fate? hahahahahahh jk. I just want you to know that I also like you, but I also want to be your bestfriend first. hehehehhehehehehehehe

      <br><br>
      I hope you like this thing i made for you hihi. I forgot to write a letter on that paper bag kasi eh! So ayan, gumawa na lang ako na letter sa computer hahahaha. I hope you read this on your birthday para happy.

      <br><br>

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY AGAIIIN!
